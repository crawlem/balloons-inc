The only thing more exciting than receiving a balloon model is making your own. Whether you're looking to entertain a group of young people or run a corporate team building event, learning to twist balloons into wonderful creations is a whole bunch of fun.

During the balloon twisting workshop delegates will learn some of the balloon basics and then progress onto making their very own hats, flowers and animals. With a mixture of demonstrations, challenges and games, this interactive workshop is a truly unique experience for older children (7+) or for adults. All the delegates will leave with their wonderful balloon models, certificate of achievement and some fun memories.
