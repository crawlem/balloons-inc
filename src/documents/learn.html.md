Whether you’re looking to entertain a group of young people or run a corporate team building event, learning to twist balloons into wonderful creations is a whole bunch of fun.

During the balloon twisting workshop the participants will learn some of the balloon basics and then progress onto making their very own hats, flowers and animals. This interactive workshop is great for older children (7+) or for adults. All the delegates will leave with their wonderful balloon models and certificate of achievement.
